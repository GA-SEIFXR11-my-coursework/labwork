## Setup
- Clone this repo down on your computer
- Just play around with it

#### **Note:** If you make any changes in your code, you may end up having conflicts the next time you try to do a git pull, maybe clone two copies of this repo, one to stay aligned and another one to tweak and twist the code to play around with it.

## Repository Structure
