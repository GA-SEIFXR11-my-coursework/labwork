# Immutable Update Patterns

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo and `git clone` it down to your computer
1. Install dependences with `npm i`
1. Run the Jest test suite with `npm test` or `npm test -- --watch`
1. Commit early, commit often
1. When you're finished or when time is up, push your work to your remote repo, file a Pull Request, and react with a green check on Zoom

---

For each of the functions you're asked to complete in [`answers.js`](./answers.js), create a new copy of the object or array with the described change - **DO NOT** mutate or manually edit the original object.

### Running the Test Suite

Run it once:

```sh
npm test
```

Start the `jest` watcher which will rerun the test suite each time you save.

```sh
npm test -- --watch
```
